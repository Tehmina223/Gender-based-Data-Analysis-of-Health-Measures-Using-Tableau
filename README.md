**Gender-based Data Analysis of Health Measures**

**Gender Based Data**

This graph shows the distribution of different health metrics (height, weight, age, BMI, and physical activity level) across different genders (female and male) and obesity categories (underweight, normal weight, obese, overweight).

**X-axis**: The X-axis represents different combinations of gender and obesity category. It shows the following groups:

**Female**: Underweight, Normal weight, Obese, Overweight

**Male**: Underweight, Normal weight, Obese, Overweight

**Y-axis**: The Y-axis represents the value of each metric, which is the sum of the metric across individuals in each group. The scale is in thousands.

For example, the first bar represents the sum of "Age" for females who are underweight. This value is approximately 11,348. The second bar represents the sum of "Age" for females who are normal weight, and so on.

By looking at the graph, you can see that:

The highest sum of physical activity level is among male individuals who are overweight.

The highest sum of age is among male individuals who are underweight.

The highest sum of weight is among male individuals who are overweight.

The highest sum of height is among male individuals who are overweight.

The highest sum of BMI is among male individuals who are overweight.

**Outcome**:
This information can be used to draw conclusions about the relationship between gender, obesity category, and different health metrics.

**Obesity Category and Metrics**

The graph shows the relationship between different obesity categories and age, BMI, physical activity level, and weight. It appears that the average age, weight, and physical activity level are highest for obese people compared to normal, overweight, or underweight people. BMI is highest for obese people.

**X-axis**: The x-axis represents the combination of gender and obesity category. Each bar group represents a specific combination, e.g., "height, weight, age, BMI, and physical activity level" represents "Male" gender and "Underweight" obesity category.

**Y-axis**: The y-axis represents the sum of the respective measure across all individuals within that specific gender and obesity category. For example, the bar "11,348" for "height, weight, age, BMI, and physical activity leve" represents the sum of all "Height" values for all male individuals who are underweight.
